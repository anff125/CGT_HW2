# How to Use It?

## At `./code`

### 1. Sequential Version:
- Run:
  ```bash
  make seq
  ```
- Then use the executable:
  ```bash
  ./agent
  ```

### 2. CUDA Version:
- Run:
  ```bash
  make
  ```
- Then use the executable:
  ```bash
  ./cuda_agent
  ```

## Running the Agent

First, install the required dependencies listed in `EWN_det_client/requirements.txt`.

Alternatively, follow the instructions in the `README` file located in the `EWN_det_client` directory:

```bash
cd ../EWN_det_client/
python3 EWN_client.pyz
```

Once the client is running, use its interface to interact with and run the agent.
